## Swift main file

Context: Basically I wanted to create another entry point to test each file isolated. Like 
I did it in Python but according to this stackoverflow answer: https://stackoverflow.com/a/25060428.

What I want to do its not possible because the only entry point its the main.

So now I have to run each method in the main file.
